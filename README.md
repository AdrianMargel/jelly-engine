This program uses a basic approach to simulating soft body physics paired with shape memory to resolve self-intersections. It's meant as a physics engine to simulate jello-like objects thus the name Jelly Engine. This runs in real time and is able to simulate visually plausable soft-body physics.

The code was written Spring 2018.
